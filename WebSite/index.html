                1) The main goal of the project is the management of the university database. The aim of this project
                is to develop software for the effective management of a university. This DBMS will be used by
                University's
                faculties. Staffs can use this DBMS for maneging, accessing and updating infomation about students,
                proforessors, courses, libraries and so on. <br> <br>
                2) The System can find, update, modify and delete information from the university database.
                For example: We can easily find infomation about what course student is in or what their grad is. Also
                which professor teaches which course. In additions we can access data on library, assistants,
                departments, sections, courses etc.

            <h1>Final Project</h1>
            <p class="text-danger">
                We were given the Final Project on November 26th.
                Well, somewhere it was +- 20 days to complete the project. Well, we are stutents and, as always, we
                will wait until the day before the deadline and start the project. I also started everything from
                scratch, 2 days before the deadline. After 2 days and sleepless nights, I finally finished the project.
                I
                will not say that the project is straight difficult. The level of difficulty, on a 5 point scale for me
                is 2 out of 5. But there were still some problems.

            <h1 class="mb-3">So why a website and not a presentation?</h1>
            <p class="text-danger">
                Well, we are programmers, I don‚Äôt think a presentation is the best option for engineers, we have gone
                through so many lessons, even this semester we have a Frontend course. Why not use the knowledge that we
                have?üíÅüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I think this way is better and everything is under control, you can easily find everything
                you
                need during the defense of the project.
                So for me there was a double practice, FrontEnd and Database. Due to the fact that I started late, I did
                not have time to add a backend. I had an idea to add a backend, when you press the keys, it immediately
                shows the date from the database, we no longer need to manually run the query every time. I will
                implement the idea after the finals. Now there's just no timeüôÉ
